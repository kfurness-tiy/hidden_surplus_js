## Synopsis

Hidden surplus is a way to rethink donations and charity contributions. Individuals can choose to sacrifice unneeded purchases and put that money to a greater cause. Hidden Surplus keeps track of the aggregate contributions and shows that together, small donations can make a big difference.

## Motivation

I want to create a way for individuals to think of ways they can use their money for a better cause without affecting their finances. If someone gives up one thing a year that they do not need but that they regularly consume and put that towards a greater cause, they can do a world of good.
