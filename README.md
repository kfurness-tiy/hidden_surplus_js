## Synopsis

Hidden surplus is a way to rethink donations and charity contributions. Individuals can choose to sacrafice uneeded purchases and put that money to a greater cause. Hidden Suplus keeps track of the aggregate contributions and shows that together, small donations can make a big difference.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

I want to create a way for individuals to think of ways they can use their money for a better cause without affecting their finances. If someone gives up one thing a year that they do not need but that they regularly consume and put that towards a greater cause, they can do a world of good.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
